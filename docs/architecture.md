# Architecture

Maljan is a FastAPI service, an arq worker and a Next.js console over Postgres,
Redis and MinIO. The service owns requests and state; the worker owns analysis
runs and everything an analysis talks to — language models, static analysis
tools, sandboxes, long-term memory and threat-intelligence lookups. This
document describes the components, what happens during a run, and the pieces an
operator can reconfigure.

## Components

| Component | Role |
| :-- | :-- |
| Console (`apps/web`) | Next.js interface: dashboard, analyses, samples, settings. Talks HTTP to the API and subscribes to the job WebSocket. |
| API (`apps/api/app`) | FastAPI application. Authentication, samples, jobs, reports, the audit trail, the settings store and the probes. |
| Worker (`apps/api/app/worker`) | arq process. Takes an analysis job, runs the pipeline, writes the report and publishes progress events. |
| Core (`src/maljan`) | The analysis package: agents, the LangGraph pipeline, the deterministic evidence layers, the provider layer, memory and reporting. |
| Postgres | Users, samples, jobs, reports, audit rows and the settings store. |
| Redis | The arq queue, the per-job event stream, and rate-limit counters. |
| MinIO | Sample bytes, in the bucket named by `MINIO_BUCKET`. |
| Qdrant | Long-term memory: past analyses and family fingerprints as vectors. |
| Tool servers (`services/`) | stdio MCP sidecars bound to one agent each: PCAP tooling for the network analyst, VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB for the judge. |

## Request and job lifecycle

1. The console authenticates and uploads a sample. The API streams it through
   `UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR`, hashes it, stores the bytes in MinIO and the metadata in
   Postgres, and writes an audit row.
2. `POST /api/v1/jobs` creates the job row and enqueues `run_analysis` on arq
   under the same identifier, so the queue job and the database row cannot
   drift apart. An optional `config` object may override a handful of pipeline
   values, including `profile`, which is validated against the profiles the
   store actually holds.
3. The worker takes the job, re-reads the configuration from the settings
   store, downloads the sample from MinIO and mirrors it into `SAMPLES_DIR`
   so the Ghidra container can read it through its bind mount.
4. The pipeline runs. Each stage publishes an event on the Redis channel for
   that job; the API relays it to the console over
   `/ws/analysis/{job_id}`. Publishing is best effort — the database row is
   always written first, so a Redis outage costs progress updates, never the
   record.
5. The report is written to Postgres and becomes available under
   `/api/v1/reports/...` in every rendering the report service supports.
6. Threat-intelligence enrichment runs afterwards as its own job, so it never
   delays the verdict.

## The pipeline

A LangGraph `StateGraph` over one shared state (`src/maljan/pipeline/`). The
analyst stage has two shapes and `parallel_analysts` chooses between them:

```
START
  │
  ├─ parallel_analysts = False  (the default)
  │     static_analyst -> dynamic_analyst -> network_analyst
  │
  └─ parallel_analysts = True
        START fans out to all three, then fans in
  │
negotiation  <-------- revision
  │  (consensus, or the iteration cap)   ^
  └─ no consensus -----------------------┘
  │
judge
  │   inside this node: the YARA and Sigma scanners, the per-technique
  │   TTP cascade, ATT&CK validation, then the STIX 2.1 bundle
  │
report  ->  END
```

Sequential is the default because a single local model server has one slot, and
fanning out three analysts onto it produces queue thrash rather than speed. Set
`parallel_analysts` when each request gets its own slot, as with a hosted API.

Agents exchange structured `AgentISR` objects — claims with an `evidence_ref`
and a confidence — rather than raw text. Objects are built and cached in one
composition root (`src/maljan/core/container.py`), and agents are discovered
through the `@register_agent` decorator in `src/maljan/agents/registry.py`.

The organising rule is that the model proposes and code disposes: the
deterministic layers under `src/maljan/analysis/` assert techniques on their
own, and a reconciliation and gating stage after the model decides what the
analyst actually receives.

## Agents and profiles

Four agent definitions ship built in: `static`, `dynamic` and `network`
analysts, and the `judge`. Each definition carries its role, whether it is
enabled, the tools it may call and — for an analyst — the static provider it
reads through. A profile names which analysts run and in which order; the
built-in `default` profile is `static, dynamic, network`, which is the
architecture this project measured itself on.

Both are editable from Settings → Agents and pipeline. A custom agent runs as a
`ConfigurableAnalyst` with the tools its definition names; a profile may not
list an analyst twice, may not include the judge, and may not name a disabled
analyst while it is the active profile.

## Providers

The provider layer (`src/maljan/providers/`) puts one interface in front of
each class of external tool, so the choice is configuration rather than code.

- **LLM** — `openai`, `anthropic`, `ollama`, `gemini`. Each has its own
  credentials, endpoint and model names; only the selected provider is used.
  Separate model choices exist for the analysts and for the judge.
- **Static** — `ghidra` (Ghidra MCP), `r2` (radare2 MCP), `capa_yara`,
  `generic_mcp` for a server of your own, and `none`.
- **Sandbox** — `mock` (the default), `cape2`, `triage`, `upload` for a report
  produced elsewhere, and `rest`, a mapping-driven adapter for a sandbox
  Maljan has never heard of.
- **Tool servers (MCP)** — additional servers declared in the settings store,
  each with the tools it is allowed to expose and the agents allowed to call
  it.

Every provider that can be reached over the network has a probe behind a Test
button in the console; see [configuration.md](configuration.md).

## Memory

Past analyses and family fingerprints are vectorised and stored in Qdrant, and
retrieved by similarity during a run (`src/maljan/memory/`). The collections,
the neighbour count and the Qdrant endpoint are settings. The ATT&CK corpus and
its embeddings are cached on disk; on the compose stack that cache is a named
volume, because rebuilding it costs the judge node about a gigabyte of resident
memory and a minute and a half on the first analysis.

## Reporting

Every run emits a structured `MalwareReport` (`src/maljan/reporting/`). The API
renders it as Markdown, HTML and PDF, and exposes the STIX 2.1 bundle, a MITRE
view, the extracted indicators, the detection signatures that fired and a
timeline. Post-hoc enrichment fills VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, WHOIS and GeoIP
reputation into the indicator set after the verdict has shipped.
