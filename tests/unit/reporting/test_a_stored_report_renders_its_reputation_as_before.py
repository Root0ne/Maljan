"""A report stored before reputation records renders byte for byte as it did.

The four stored benchmark runs carry no ``reputation`` records (the field is
absent from their JSON), so their reputation line is read by the legacy
reading of their section rows (``core.legacy_reputation``). Their Markdown,
their HTML and their STIX bundle (ids and timestamps normalised) are the
digests ``origin/dev`` 2c2522b2 renders. Skipped where the stored runs are not
on the machine.

# ``(markdown, html with the nonce "fixed", normalised STIX)`` as dev 2c2522b2 renders them.
# The Markdown and HTML were re-pinned when a sample's, a tool's or a finding's
# text came to print escaped (F7); the STIX did not change.
# Re-pinned when every IOC-table row came to carry a publish answer and the
# export to name the sample by its identity digests (T-344, T-345): a dropped file's
# digest row the record names no process for now prints its refusal, so does
# a command line, the sample's indicator adds its SHA-1 and MD5, its imphash
# is an anomalous-activity indicator of its own, and an indicator's reason is
# read from the rebuilt table.
# The Markdown and HTML re-pinned when §10.2's introduction came to say each
# draft rule's body is printed as written (T-357): that one line is the only
# change; the STIX did not change.
# The STIX re-pinned when the export's own malware object came to carry the
# types the published category names after the category as written (T-337):
# ``loader`` gains ``downloader``. run4's Markdown and HTML re-pinned with it:
# its eight key findings wrote their citations into the sentence, and each is
# no longer printed a second time after it; nothing else changed.
# The Markdown and HTML re-pinned when Appendix A came to draw held code whole
# as listings and to say where a cut value is whole (T-384): only Appendix A and
# Appendix D changed; the STIX did not change.
# The Markdown and HTML re-pinned when the host identifier table came to mark
# each row the IOC table publishes and its footer to say the table publishes
# nothing itself (T-386); the STIX did not change.
